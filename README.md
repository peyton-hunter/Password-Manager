# Password_Manager

Stores website, email and password data as JSON file. Option to generate a new password (copies to clipboard).
Ability to search for username/email and password by typing in website and clicking "search".
  - Case sensitive, would be good to fix this in the future. Another idea would be to search for the website splitting at the TLD.
